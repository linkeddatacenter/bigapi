Perceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace
==========================================

**BIGAPI** is an architectural design pattern and template designed for effective communication and documentation of software architectures. It addresses modern data-centered, cloud-native applications based on the best practices promoted by the W3C consortium. BIGAPI assists software development teams in describing and communicating software architecture during both initial design sessions and retrospective documentation of existing codebases. It facilitates the creation of "maps of your code" at various levels of detail, considering different points of view.

BIGAPI streamlines the process of documenting and communicating software architecture, making it more manageable and efficient. By leveraging proven practices and supporting a wide range of technologies and development methodologies, BIGAPI serves as a valuable tool for teams developing modern applications.


## Purpose
BIGAPI pragmatically answers two fundamental questions and can be tailored to meet specific needs:

- What should you document/communicate about your architecture?
- How should you document/communicate it?

## Key Features
- **Documentation structure:** Provides everything you need to construct, communicate, and document your software architecture, making the process practical and less burdensome.
- **Inspirations and Foundations:** Draws inspiration from the W3C [WEB architecture](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/), [ARC42](https://arc42.org/) architectural template, and the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/), built upon practical experience from numerous systems across various domains.
- **Technology Agnostic:** Supports arbitrary technologies and tools, ensuring versatility across different projects and platforms.
- **Process-Agnostic:** Completely independent of specific processes, making it well-suited for lean and agile development approaches.
- **Open Source:** Available with  open-source license and free to use in non-commercial situations. Refer to our license page for more details.


## Philosophy Behind the Name
The name **BIGAPI** is a scrambled acronym for "**Perceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace**": **B**eauty, **I**ts, **G**race, **A**cknowledge, **P**erceive, **I**ts.

The idea is to highlight how elegance and beauty can manifest in software architecture, much like patterns in nature. By creating systems with recognizable structures and balanced, lightweight components, aesthetic principles guide the design even before functional requirements. Graceful and well-proportioned architecture leads to software that is not only efficient but also intuitively understandable.


## Benefits
- **Enhanced Communication:** Offers a structured template for documenting and communicating software and system architectures, promoting better understanding among team members and stakeholders.
- **Flexible Detailing:** Allows the creation of architectural documentation at various levels of detail, accommodating different perspectives and requirements.


## Template
We provide you with the **BIGAPI template** for architectural documentation â€” a comprehensive index designed to simplify your documentation process. This template serves as a structured framework where you can seamlessly **fill in your architecture decisions**, capturing every critical aspect of your system's design. By using BIGAPI, the once daunting task of documenting your architecture becomes **simple, effective, and painless**, allowing you to focus more on developing robust solutions rather than getting bogged down by complex documentation procedures.

The architectural documentation template is be organized in 10 sections:
- [Getting Started](template/getting-started.md): What do you need to know about the project
- [Conformance](template/conformance.md): Regulatory compliance and industry standards adopted by Argento.
- [Glossary](template/glossary.md): The main terms used in the project jargon
- [Architecture](template/architecture.md): The system big picture according different points of view
- [Features](template/features.md): The feature sheets that catalogues all the features implemented by the system
- [Components](template/components.md): TShe catalog of the technical components and configuration items that buildsup the project
- [Stereotypes](template/stereotypes.md): The source of truth for shared pieces of component documentation.
- [Skills](template/skills.md): Competence required in  roles
- [Roles](template/roles.md): Mission and skills required in the project operations
- [Processes](template/processes.md): The ways to make things done
